Emote demonstrated with rpemotes by [TayMcKenzieNZ](https://github.com/TayMcKenzieNZ/rpemotes) 
Emote adapting the prop to add to AnimationListCustom.lua (I'm sure there's a better animation this just works for me):
>    ["mushroom"] = { --- Prop by Bostra
        "mp_player_inteat@burger",
        "mp_player_int_eat_burger",
        "Mushroom",
        AnimationOptions = {
            Prop = 'mushroom',
            PropBone = 60309,
            PropPlacement = {
                0.000,
                0.0300,
                -0.0700,
                60.0000,
                0.0000,
                1.0000
            },
            EmoteMoving = true
        }
    },
